    "desc01": "Breast cancer develops in breast cells, typically in lobules that are the glands that produce milk, and ducts that bring the milk from the breast lobule to the nipple. There are many treatments for breast cancer – they include surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biological therapy, and radiation therapy. The appropriate treatment plans are based on the type of breast cancer, its stage, and any special conditions particular to the patient. In many cases of breast cancers, the doctor would opt for physical surgery whereby the affected tissue is removed by surgery. In other cases, chemotherapy would be the treatment of choice whereby certain therapeutic medicine is used to specifically target the cancer affected areas in order to kill or shrink cancer cells in the area. In come cases, hormonal therapy may be used, which essentially helps to block the growth of breast cancer cells by limiting the hormones the cells need in order to replicate and grow. In some cases, radiation therapy is the answer by which the affected cancer cells are zapped by radiation. In reality, many doctors would combine some treatments in order to arrive at an optimal result. The treatment path differ by the individual situation and conditions pertaining to the individual person. The proper treatments depend on the right diagnostics and the doctor's experience.",
    "subtitle02": "Chemotherapy",
    "desc02": "According to the American Cancer Association, the word chemotherapy refers to the use of any drug to treat any disease. However, to most people, the word chemotherapy or simply “chemo” typically refers to the drugs used for cancer treatment. It's important to know that not all medicines and drugs to treat cancer work equally. Long ago, the only type of drug that could treat cancer was traditional or standard chemo, but now there are many types of drugs used to treat cancer. While traditional or standard chemotherapy may still the best way to treat many cancers, different kinds of new drugs may offer better results for others.\n\nThere are three main goals a doctor will use chemotherapy for: to cure, to control, or for palliation. \nIf your doctor has recommended chemotherapy to treat your cancer, it is important to understand the goals of treatment so that you fully understand the treatment choice for yourself. \n\nWhen possible, chemo is used to cure cancer, which means that the cancer is destroyed and does not come back. However, most doctors will avoid using the word “cure”, instead will describe the prescribed treatment having a curative intent. Cancer is is resilient, and often the patient will need many years to know if it is recurring or not.\n\nWhen a cure is not possible, the goal of chemotherapy treatment may be to control the disease whereby chemo is used to shrink tumors and/or stop the cancer from growing and spreading to other areas, which can help the patient lessen the pain and live longer.\n\nAnd finally, in some situations, the chemotherapy's goal is simply palliative to reduce the symptoms caused by the cancer.",
    "subtitle03": "Surgery for stomach cancer",
    "desc03": "Surgery is a common treatment for stomach cancer, especially when the cancer is in its early stages. In some situations, minimally invasive surgical techniques may be used when performing gastrectomy to lessen the risk for complications, shorten recovery time, and minimize pain. However, stomach cancers that are advanced may require a partial or total gastrectomy.\n\nMinimally invasive surgery methods include laparoscopy and robot-assisted surgery. In laparoscopy, the surgeon inserts a thin, lit tube with a video recording device at the tip into the abdomen through a small skin incision. The surgeon can then operate through this small opening with specialized instruments. In robot-assisted surgery, a surgeon uses a robotic surgical tool to perform the operation from a console that displays a magnified three-dimensional image of the inside of the abdomen, highlighted with a fluorescent dye. In partial gastrectomy, parts of the affected stomach, nearby tissues and organs, and nearby lymph nodes are removed when determined to be cancerous. In total gastrectomy, the entire stomach is removed but may also remove other organs or parts of other organs if they are affected by the cancer. To enable eating and swallowing normally, the surgeon then connects the esophagus to the small intestine.",
    "subtitle04": "Radiation therapy",
    "desc04": "Radiation therapy or simply radiotherapy (RT, RTx, or XRT), is a cancer treatment therapy that uses ionizing radiation. The radiation, delivered via a linear accelerator is meant to kill  malignant cells.  Radiation therapy may be the right choice if the cancer is limited to a  localized area.\n\n Radiation therapy kills cancer cells or slows their growth by damaging their DNA. Cancer  cells whose DNA is damaged beyond repair stop dividing or die. When the damaged cells  die, they are broken down and removed by the body, which can take days or weeks of  treatment before DNA is damaged enough for cancer cells to die. \n\n There are two main types of radiation therapy, external beam and internal.  The type of  radiation therapy administered will depend on a number of factors which include type of  cancer, size of tumor, location of the tumor, general health of the patient, etc.\n\n External beam radiation therapy comes from a machine that aims radiation at the cancer.  The machine is large and may be noisy. While it does not touch the patient, it can move  around the patient while sending radiation to the affected areas.\n\n Internal radiation therapy with a solid source is called brachytherapy. In this type of  treatment, seeds, ribbons, or capsules that contain a radiation source are placed near the  tumor. Like external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy is a local treatment and treats  only a specific part of the body that is affected by the cancer.",
    "subtitle05": "Brain cancer",
    "desc05": "Brain cancer is the formation of malignant tumors in the brain which can have a variety of         symptoms including seizures, sleepiness, confusion, and behavioral changes. Brain cancer         can be primary or secondary, meaning, that it can start in th brain or start at a different         place and expand to the brain.\n\n        The symptoms of a brain cancer depend on where in the brain the tumor forms, the         tumor’s size, and how fast the tumor spreads. Cancer treatments can also cause symptoms        and side effects. Types of symptoms that may occur from cancer in the brain are:\n        Physical symptoms which can include headaches, seizures, nausea, muscle weakness,         vision problems, and digestive problems.\n\n        Cognitive symptoms affect how a patient’s brain processes information leading to         personality changes, confusion, judgment impairment, memory loss, and socially         inappropriate behavior.\n\n        Emotional symptoms may include extreme stress, depression, anxiety, anger.\n\n        If a patient is suspected of having brain cancer, a number of tests are recommended in         order to determine for certain which may include a neurological exam, imaging tests such         as MRI's, a biopsy sample, etc. A well-experienced doctor will know how to ascertain the         presence of brain cancer properly.",
    "subtitle06": "Treatment of prostate cancer",
    "desc06": "Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate gland that produces the seminal fluid        that nourishes and transports the sperm. Prostate cancer is quite common and affects         many men. Treatment of prostate cancer often tends to be localized as the cancer tends to        spread slowly, which is a positive aspect of the type of cancer. Because prostate cancer         often grows slowly, active surveillance may be the preferred treatment option for some        men, with the oncologist closely monitoring the disease with tests and holding off on         treatment until a later date.\n\n        There are many options for the treatment of prostate cancer and there are several types         of doctors who can perform the treatments. Urologists, radiation oncologists, and medical         oncologists can provide diagnosis and treatments such as surgery, radiation, cryotherapy,         hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. \n\n        If a patient has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, an experienced doctor should discuss        the various available treatment options. It's important to weigh the benefits of each         treatment option relative to the possible risks and side effects.",
    "subtitle07": "Diabetes treatment",
    "desc07": "Diabetes is a disease in which the blood glucose (sugar) levels are too high, which can         result in a number of complications. A large part of treating diabetes is maintaining a         healthy life style with foods rich in nutrients and regular exercise. However, in some cases,         medical treatments are necessary.Treatment for the more serious type 1 diabetes involves injections of insulin, periodic         blood sugar checks, and carbohydrate counting. Treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily         involves lifestyle changes, monitoring of blood sugar readings, along with diabetes         medications, insulin or a combination.\n\n        Many types of insulin are available nowadays. These include short-acting, rapid-acting         insulin, long-acting insulin and intermediate options. A doctor will assess the specific needs         of the patient and prescribe a combination of insulin types to use throughout the day and         night.\n\n        Insulin cannot be taken orally to lower blood sugar because the stomach enzymes inhibit         the insulin's action. Often insulin is injected using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin         pen.\n\n        An insulin pump also may be an option. The pump is a device about the size of a small         cellphone worn on the outside of the body that connects the reservoir of insulin to a         catheter  inserted under the skin of the abdomen through a connecting delivery tube.\n\n        In some situations, an oral medication may be the option. The oral medication induces         the pancreas to produce more insulin.\n\n        The choice of treatment option for diabetes largely depends on the condition and         situation of the patient and the diagnosing doctor's confidence of which option to go with in         order to produce the most desirable results.

    "subtitle08": "Brain stroke",
    "desc08": "A brain stroke or simply “stroke” occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is         interrupted or reduced, hindering the brain tissue from accessing oxygen and nutrients,         resulting in brain cells dying within minutes of an occurrence of stroke.\n\n        A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial in saving life and normal         bodily functions. However, nowadays many fewer people die of stroke relative to the past         due to faster and more effective treatments available to many. There are two main types of         stroke: ischemic stroke (blocked artery) and hemorrhagic stroke (bursting of a blood         vessel). However, some may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the         brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or “mini stroke”, which does not cause         lasting symptoms.\n\n        Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke which happens when the brain's blood         vessels become narrowed or blocked, resulting in severely reduced blood flow. Blocked or         narrowed blood vessels are typically caused by fat build up in blood vessels or by blood         clots or other debris that travel through the bloodstream and remain in the blood vessels of         the brain.\n\n        Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. Brain         hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect the blood vessels. Common         factors include uncontrolled high blood pressure, overuse of blood thinners         (anticoagulants), bulges at weak spots in the blood vessel walls (aneurysms), trauma from         accidents, protein deposits in the blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel         wall (cerebral amyloid angiopathy), and ischemic stroke leading to hemorrhage.",
    "subtitle09": "Treatment of hypertension",
    "desc09": "Hypertension or simply known as “high blood pressure” is the most common preventable         cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide and can lead to severe health         complications and can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and even death. It is         commonly referred as a “silent killer” because it slowly damages the heart, blood vessels,         and other organs often without any immediate symptoms. Hypertension is a major risk         factor for the development of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, chronic kidney         disease, peripheral artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. Although hypertension can be         readily diagnosed and normally successfully treated with improvements in lifestyle and with         well-tolerated inexpensive medications, hypertension continues to be a major cause of         morbidity and mortality globally.\n\n        Traditionally, hypertension was treated simply by lowering salt intake, avoiding stressful         environments and situations, cessation of smoking, eating a healthy diet, regual aerobic         exercise, and limiting the intake of alcohol. However, there are also many medications now         available and accessible to many around the world. These drugs include angiotensin-converting enzyme or better known as  “ACE” inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers,         diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, alpha-agonists, renin         inhibitors, or a combination of medications.\n\n        Treatment for hypertension has also been associated with reductions in stroke (average         reduction of 35%-40%), heart attack (20%-25%), and heart failure (more than 50%),         according to some research. Therefore, positive lifestyle changes and sometimes         medications can not only enhance the reduction of hypertension itself but also a list of         potentially harmful conditions that are related.

    "subtitle10": "Diagnosis of a heart attack",
    "desc10": "Typically, a diagnosis for the risk factors that can lead to a heart attack would be done in        a regular physical exam. There are tests that can diagnose a heart attack, which include         Electrocardiogram or “ECG”. This test diagnoses a heart attack by recording electrical         signals as they travel through the heart. Electrode patches are attached to the chest area         and limbs while signals are recorded as waves displayed on a monitor or printed on paper.         Because the injured heart muscle doesn't conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG         test may show that a heart attack has occurred or is in progress. This is a non-invasive test.\n\n        Also, because certain heart proteins can slowly leak into the blood stream after heart         damage from a heart attack, doctors can take blood samples to check for these proteins, or        enzymes and conclude an occurrence of heart attack. This is called an invasive test.\n\n        These diagnostics can tell a lot to an experienced doctor. They can reveal if a patient had        a heart attack, how much damage was done and what extent a coronary artery disease has        been developed.\n\n        The heart muscle needs a stable and constant supply of oxygenated blood. The         coronary arteries deliver to the heart this critical blood supply. If a patient has coronary         artery disease, those arteries become narrow, and blood cannot flow freely, potentially         resulting in a heart attack. Fat, calcium, proteins, and inflammatory cells build up in the         arteries to form what is known as plaque. These plaque deposits are dangerous and can         increase the risk of a heart attack.",
    "subtitle11": "Treatment of skin cancer",
    "desc11": "Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells, often as a result of excessive exposure        to the sun without protection. However, skin cancer can also occur on areas of the skin not         normally exposed to sunlight. There are three major types of skin cancer - basal cell         carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.\n\n        Basal cell carcinoma which is the abnormal, uncontrolled growth of basal cells, is the         most common form of skin cancer and the most frequently occurring form of all cancers.         When diagnosed early and treated early, this type of cancer is often curable and cause         minimal damage. Often, surgical removal of the affected area is the recommended         treatment. Once again, early detection and treatment is the essential as in some         occurrences, this type of cancer can spread to other parts of the body such as the bones         nearby.\n\n        Squamous cell carcinoma can spread more rapidly and affect areas nearby. When         caught early, almost all squamous cell carcinomas of the skin can be successfully treated.         But when caught at a more advanced stage, it can become dangerous. Many types of         treatments are available including excisional surgery, Mohs surgery, cryosurgery,         electrosurgery, laser surgery, radiation, photodynamic therapy, as well as topical         medications.\n\n        Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that begins in melanocyte cells. While it is         less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma is         more dangerous because of its ability to spread to other organs more rapidly if it is not         treated early. Treatment for melanoma may include surgery, radiation therapy,         chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of the mentioned ones.         The individual treatment plan depends on how early the disease was caught and whether it        has spread and to which organs or tissue.",
    "subtitle12": "Diagnosis of hepatitis",
    "desc12": "Hepatitis refers to a condition marked by liver inflammation typically as a result of a viral         infection although other reasons such as medications, drugs, toxins, and alcohol can also         render the disease. The treatments available for hepatitis depends on how early the         disease was caught, the severity, the type of hepatitis, the individual's unique symptoms,         etc.\n\n        For example, If a patient has been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, an injection of         immunoglobulin antibody given within 12 hours of exposure to the virus may help protect         the patient from getting sick with hepatitis B. Because this treatment only provides short-term protection, the patient should get the hepatitis B vaccine at the same time, if nt         vaccinated in prior times. Also, most people diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B infection         need treatment for the rest of their lives as it is not curable. Treatment helps reduce the risk        of liver disease and limits the spread of the disease. Treatment for chronic hepatitis B         include:\n        Antiviral medications including entecavir, tenofovir, lamivudine, adefovir, and telbivudine - can help fight the virus and slow liver damage.\n        Interferon is a man-made version of a substance produced by the body to fight infection. It's        used mainly for young people with hepatitis B who wish to avoid long-term treatment or         women who might want to get pregnant within a few years, after completing a finite course         of therapy. Interferon should not be used during pregnancy as there are ample side effects         such as nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and depression.\n        If the affected liver has been severely damaged, a liver transplant may be an option to         consider. Most liver transplants come from deceased donors but some come from people         willing to share their liver.\n        With hepatitis A, which is considered highly contagious but is not a long-term infection and         usually has no long lasting complications, is preventable with a vaccine.         With hepatitis C, which is usually a long term infection leading to liver scarring or cirrhosis,         is not preventable with a vaccine yet. The treatment can often be surgical and a         subsequent combination of relevant drugs.        ",
    "subtitle13": "Treatment of back pain",
    "desc13": "Back pain may be continuous or sudden, mild or life altering. Back pain is considered         chronic if it lasts three months or longer. It can come and go, with intermittent temporary         relief. While back pain is largely age-related, it can occur as a result of injury. The common         causes of back pain include spinal arthritis which is the gradual thinning of the cartilage         inside the spine, spinal stenosis which is the narrowing of the spinal canal leading to nerve         pain, disc problems, such as herniated or bulging discs, and myofascial pain syndrome         such as muscle pain and tenderness. Many of these conditions can be treated with various         type of surgery, some being minimally invasive and epidural injections, which are steroid         injections delivered to the needed area via a syringe. In some cases, it’s difficult to pinpoint the cause of chronic back pain, in which case it is         advised a patient seeks a second or even third opinion from a trusted doctor. Ill diagnosed         back pains and related treatments can sometimes be worse than no treatment at all.\n\n        However, if after all the efforts, the source of the pain is not known or cannot be treated,         the best option may be to reduce the flare-ups and making the pain manageable with         nonsurgical treatments such as physical therapy, meditation, diet, lifestyle changes,         pharmacological and alternative medicine treatments.\n\n        It must be noted that it is estimated that a vast majority of patients’ back pain issues are         treated without surgery. Experienced doctors might turn to surgery in some cases to help         relieve pain caused by severe nerve compression or prior musculoskeletal injuries. Surgery         isn’t always successful and patients should know the risks prior to considering having a         procedure done.        ",
    "subtitle14": "Treatment of Lou Gehrig's disease",
    "desc14": "Lou Gehrig's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive nervous         system illness that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in loss of         muscle control. As the disease progresses, the affected patient loses the ability to walk,         speak, swallow, and eventually, to even breathe, in the final stages. It is called Lou Gehrig's        disease, after the namesake baseball player who was diagnosed with it in 1939.\n\n        There is no known cure for Lour Gehrig's disease, but doctors offer treatments and         therapies that can slow down or ease the symptoms of the illness. However, researchers         continue to research for cures and treatments.\n\n        There are two medications which have proven helpful in slowing the progression of Lou         Gehrig's disease and thus. extending the life of those who have been diagnosed with the         disease. While these drugs can help slow down the time when the patient will need         mechanical help to breathe, they cannot cure damage already done to other parts of the         body. The first is edaravone, administered through intravenous injection, is an antioxidant         that can help to prevent damage to nerve cells from destructive substances called free         radicals. But it is unclear how it works to slow the physical progression of patients with Lou         Gehrig's disease. The other one is riluzole, which is taken orally, helps to reduce damage to        the motor nerves by reducing the amount of glutamate in the nervous system. (Glutamate         has the role of carrying chemical messages to the nerves and an excessive amount of it         can damage the cells.\n\n        Managing the symptoms of Lou Gehrig's disease can also include a host of activities         that have been shown to have some palliative effects including physical therapy, exercise,         warm baths and proper diet.\n\n        Lou Gehrig's disease is an illness without a cure for now and the affected people are         looking forward just as much as the researchers themselves to eventually find a cure. Until         then, managing the disease via treatments is the best solution we have for now.",
    "subtitle15": "Treatment of obesity",
    "desc15": "Obesity if defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation of the body that presents a        risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 30 is considered obese. Obesity is a complex         disease and the reasons are diverse. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It is a medical         problem that increases the risk of developing other diseases and health problems, such as         heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, immune problems, and certain cancers.         Obesity affects negatively one's health, one's life span, and one's overall quality of life.\n\n        Treatments largely depend on the severity of the condition, the physical ability of the         person suffering obesity, and various other factors specific to the individual. The goal of         obesity treatment is to reach and maintain a healthy weight. This improves the overall         health and lowers the risk of developing problems related to obesity. \n\n        For those who are able to exercise and adapt to a better diet, can see improvements to         their health by slowly and safely losing weight. Often, many will target a modest weight loss        goal such as 5% to 10% of their weight, with the key takeaway being that they should         maintain the newly established weight. While the greater the loss of weight is the greater         the improvements, the more important point is that weight taken off should be kept off. All         weight-loss programs require changes in eating habits and increased physical activity. The         treatment methods that are right depend on the obesity severity, the overall health, and the         willingness to participate in the weight-loss plan.\n\n        In some extreme cases, weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is an option to         consider. Weight-loss surgery limits the amount of food one is able to eat or decreases the         absorption of food and calories, or both. Although weight-loss surgery offers the best         chance of losing the most significant weight, it can pose serious risks to one's health, thus         the patient should have tried other methods to lose weight that haven't worked and surgery         should be the last resort. Additional conditions which tilt the decision to consider bariatric         surgery are extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) and the patient is committed to making the        lifestyle changes that are necessary for surgery to work, as it requires a lot of sarifice in         terms of lifestyle and behavior.",
    "subtitle16": "Treatment of ovarian cancer",
    "desc16": "Ovarian cancer is the condition whereby cells in a woman's ovary begin to multiply out of         control and form a tumor. Ovarian cancer can often go undetected until it has spread to the         pelvis and belly. At this late stage, ovarian cancer is difficult to treat and can be fatal. Early         detection and treatment is the best option with this type of cancer.\n\n        Treatment of ovarian cancer is typically a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. But         targeted therapy and palliative care is also often accompanied. In surgical procedures,         operations are done to remove the affected ovary or ovaries. For early stage ovarian         cancer that hasn't spread beyond one ovary, surgery may involve removing the affected         ovary and its fallopian tube. This procedure may preserve fertility as there is a surviving         ovary and fallopian tube. If the ovarian cancer is present in both ovaries without having         spread to other ares of the body, a surgeon may remove both ovaries and both fallopian         tubes. This procedure leaves your uterus intact, so pregnancy is still possible with frozen         embryos or eggs.\n\n        In a third scenario whereby the cancer is more developed, surgery can be done to         remove both ovaries and the uterus, but eliminates the ability to conceive. If the cancer is         more extensive, the surgeon will remove the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the uterus, nearby        lymph nodes and a fold of fatty abdominal tissue, as well.        \n\n        In some advanced cases, a doctor may recommend chemotherapy in conjunction with         surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Chemotherapy is a drug treatment         that uses special chemicals to kill the cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be injected         into a vein or taken by mouth but at times the drugs are injected directly into the abdomen.        \n\n        In the clinical stage treatments, targeted therapy uses medications that target the specific        vulnerabilities present within the cancer cells. Targeted therapy drugs are usually reserved         for treating recurrent ovarian cancer after initial treatment or cancer that resists other         methods of treatments. \n\n        In all the above listed treatments, palliative treatments and family support has been         shown to lessen the pain a patient experiences and can actually extend a patient's life to a         degree.",
    "subtitle17": "Diagnosis of stomach ulcers",
    "desc17": "Stomach ulcers are open sores that develop when the lining of the stomach has become         damaged due to a variety of causes. Stomach ulcers are also called gastric ulcers. The         primary method a doctor can detect the presence of a stomach ulcer is to look and find         visual evidence. Doctors may employ the use of X-rays or a test called an endoscopy. This         test works by passing a thin flexible tube down the throat and into the stomach and small         intestine for a visual check.\n\n        If a stomach ulcer is present, treatment will depend on what caused it. With the proper         treatment, most ulcers heal in a month or two. If the stomach ulcer is caused by a         Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection, a course of antibiotics and a medication         called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is typically the recommended treatment. The antibiotics        most commonly used for this treatment are amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole.         This treatment course is also recommended if the stomach ulcer is caused by a         combination of an H. pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If the         stomach ulcer is simply caused by taking NSAID's, a course of PPI medication is the         recommended course of treatment. Omeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole are the         PPI's most commonly administered to treat stomach ulcers. Thereafter, an alternative         NSAID is explored for better tolerance. An alternative type of prescription drugs, known as         H2-receptor antagonists such as ranitidine, is also occasionally used instead of PPI's.        All the above mentioned treatments may take a while to take into effect, so a doctor may         also prescribe an antacids and alginates that help from a palliative perscpective as well as         coating the stomach with a protective coating.\n\n        During treatment, avoiding stress, alcohol, spicy foods, and smoking may reduce the         symptoms while the ulcer takes time to heal. A gastroscopy after 4 to 6 weeks is normally         administered to check that the stomach ulcer has healed.",
    "subtitle18": "Treatment of uterine fibroids",
    "desc18": "Uterine fibroids are benign non-cancerous growths in the uterus that most often appear         during childbearing years. Also called leiomyomas or myomas, uterine fibroids are not         associated with an increased risk of developing uterine cancer. Fibroids can range in size         from tiny, barely detectable by the human eye, to larger masses that can reshape and         enlarge the uterus. One can have a single fibroid or multiple ones and in extreme cases,         multiple fibroids can enlarge the uterus to a point where it reaches the rib cage.        While many who are affected do not have any symptoms, some may experience heavy         menses, long lasting menstrual periods (over a week), pelvic pressure or pain, frequent         urination, difficulty fully emptying urine, constipation, backache, or leg pains.        The best treatments are not exactly known yet. If the conditions are asymptomatic, many         doctors believe it is best to leave it as is. However, in cases that the condition is extreme         and hampers with daily life quality, some methods such as various types of surgery are         recommended.\n\n        In such cases, removal of the uterus or “hysterectomy” is an option for women who are         done having biological children or do not plan on having any in the future. With the uterus         removed, new fibroids cannot form. Traditionally, hysterectomy involves a surgeon making         a large incision in the abdomen, resulting in visible large scar(s). However, today with         laparascopic hysterectomy, the surgeon removes the uterus through small incisions in the         wall of the abdomen which results in faster recovery, less scarring, and typically fewer         complications than with a traditional hysterectomy.\n\n        Laparascopic hysterectomy was typically accompanied by a procedure called power         morcellation, which uses a mechanical device to cut the uterus into fragments so it can be         removed through the small incisions. But nowadays it is recommended avoiding the use of         power morcellation due to the small chance that a woman having surgery to remove         fibroids may have undetected uterine cancer. In such cases, if power morcellation is         performed, there is a risk that the morcellation procedure will spread the undetected cancer        throughout the surrounding tissue and organs such as the pelvis.",
    "subtitle19": "Diagnosis of rheumatism",
    "desc19": "Rheumatism is a condition that causes chronic, intermittent pain affecting the joints or         connective tissue of the body. Included in this ailment category are many types of arthritis         or musculoskeletal diseases which include symptoms such as joint pain, loss of motion in a         joint or joints, and Inflammation or swelling in a joint or an affected area.        \n\n        Rheumatism can be challenging to diagnose in the early stages because the initial signs         and symptoms are similar to those of many other illnesses. There is no single blood test or         physical to confirm the diagnosis. Typically during a physical exam, the doctor will check the        joints to see swelling, redness and warmth as initial rough judgment. Symptoms may be         intermittent, and they are not the same in all people who have it. But doctors do look for         specific signs such as joint pain/swelling/stiffness, especially in small joints such as the         wrists, hands, and feet. Also, they look for discomfort for at least six weeks, morning         stiffness that lasts at least 30 minutes, frequent fatigue, and loss of appetite.        \n\n        What makes it especially difficult to properly diagnose is that rheumatism can resemble         the following ailments and conditions: lupus, Sjogren’s syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, Lyme         disease arthritis, and osteoarthritis among others. Sometimes, a lab test can help identify         the rheumatism with such tests as rheumatoid factor test, anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated         peptide) tests, and ANA, or antinuclear antibodies for the presence of specific antibodies.        \n\n        Rheumatism is an ailment that especially benefits from having the diagnosis done by an         experienced doctor with ample knowledge from his past successes identifying the         condition, which is something we, at CloudHospital, feel well equipped to help the patients         identify with confidence.",
    "subtitle20": "Treatment of prostatitis.",
    "desc20": "Prostatitis is the inflammation of the prostate gland. The prostate gland is a critical organ in         men which produces semen that nourishes and transports sperm. Prostatitis often causes         pain or difficulty during urination. Common causes of prostatitis may include bacterial         infection, injury, or an immune system problem. Symptoms may include difficulty in         urination, groin pain, pelvic area pain, cloudy urine, blood in urine, genital pain, ejaculation         pain, and flu-like symptoms. Prostatitis may get better on its own or if caused by a bacterial         infection, antibiotics may be prescribed for treatment.        \n\nAcute bacterial prostatitis is often caused by common strains of bacteria when bacteria         present in urine leaks into the prostate. In such cases, common antibiotics are used to treat        the infection. If the course of the antibiotics does not eliminate the bacterial infection,         prostatitis might recur or be difficult to treat and result in a chronic prostatitis state. Also,         nerve damage as a result of surgery or trauma to the area, might contribute to prostatitis         not caused by a bacterial infection. In many cases of prostatitis, the cause is not clearly         identified and may linger due to re-occurrence.        \n\nIn addition to antibiotics to kill off the infection, alpha-blockers may help lessen the painful         syndromes when urinating, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may offer pain relief from         soreness and swelling, and sometimes natural supplements such as quercetin have been         shown to play an anti-inflammatory treatment function."

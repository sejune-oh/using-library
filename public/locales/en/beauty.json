    "subtitle01": "Plastic Surgery ",
    "desc01": "Plastic surgery or cosmetic surgery, isa very popular set of procedures to accentuate or lessen certain bodily features to achieve a personally desired look. Sometimes, plastic surgery procedures are done out of necessity due to damages of the face or other parts of the body from an accident or a life-threatening surgery, such as those due to breast cancer. Many people visit Korea for its excellence in plastic surgery. The country has amassed ample experience in achieving the desired results for the patients over the years. The industry depth is tremendous with lots of experienced surgeons, state of the art equipment, and a great aesthetic understanding due to the cultural affinity towards beauty.\n\nCloudHospital has relationships with many plastic surgeons and clinics, including the most regarded ones who are well known in the industry. Many of the doctors are difficult to book on one's own, but we can help speed up the process due to our relationships, experience, and effort. We also offer plastic surgery consultations online facilitated via our proprietary telemedicine platform which can help you make the right decision prior to seriously considering having plastic surgery performed.",
    "subtitle02": "Dermatology",
    "desc02": "Dermatology is the branch of medicine that deals with the skin and its myriad potential problems. It is a specialty that has medical and surgical aspects. A dermatologist is able treat diseases related to skin, hair, and nails as well as some cosmetic issues. Some of the common issues why someone may visit a dermatologist are acne, eczema, psoriasis, hives, and rosacea.\n\nAcne is possibly the most common reason why someone may visit a dermatology specialist at a nearby clinic, especially so during one's adolescence when various changes to the body occurs â€“ which is very normal. Hives, on the other hand, are usually a result of exposure to some insect bites, food, or medication. Hives appear as raised red welts on the skin and are typically very itchy, requiring some form of treatment in more severe cases. CloudHospital can readily book you for an appointment with a vetted dermatologist around the globe for an in-person check-up or through telemedicine using our proprietary platform.",
    "subtitle03": "Dental",
    "desc03": "Dental care has evolved to a wide range of services from both the medical and aesthetic perspectives. While it may not be obvious to an average layman, the field of dentistry has evolved to offer many choices of treatments for a number of common issues such as caries, orthodontics, implants, and general periodic care and maintenance. Not only are there advances in technology for the methods used in delivering dental care, but also materials that closely replicate the look and feel of actual teeth including many newly developed types of porcelain. The field of orthodontics has advanced, as well, to include custom fitted transparent plastic trays used for straightening teeth to replace the old method of using steel wires. This new technology virtually eliminates the major drawbacks of having unsightly metal wires wrapped around your teeth, visible to others.\n\nCloudHospital can help you book with the best dental care clinics around the world with minimal effort. We thoroughly vet the providers which can help you rest assured that you are getting the best dental care. We also provide online dental consultations through our proprietary telemedicine platform, which is especially helpful for those who are unable to readily travel."

    "desc_1": "works with our platform and why you should consider us",
    "desc_2": "There are many benefits of using our online consultations for a number of issues or concerns you may have. First of all, there is the convenience of having your medical and non-medical (such as cosmetic surgery) questions answered through our consultation platform from the comfort of your home or office. Also, you will save a lot of time no longer having to physically go to consult with many healthcare providers and compare prices, a process that will require a lot of time and effort spent. Using our consultation platform, you can easily obtain a fully customized invoice directly from the best hospital after your consultation, which saves your precious time and money.\n\nIn addition to the convenience and money saved from online consultations, CloudHospital constantly strives to offer our clients full transparency in the entire process. For example, in the beauty sector, there is a lack of comparable transparency that might help a client choose the right clinic and doctor. However, with our help in the process, our clients can rest assured they are getting full transparency in learning about the options, what is possible, time required, costs, etc. More importantly, our clients can rely on us to help them compare the available options and cut through the medical industry jargon into simpler normal everyday language terms to enable them to best choose which path take.",
